# chronograph

A natural language date/time parser in the spirit
of [chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic), but with a subset of its
functionality.

There already exists a port of chronic in its entirety (as far as I know)
called [chronicity](https://github.com/chaitanyagupta/chronicity), that even
follows the file structure of the original project. This library is neither as
complete, nor as faithful to the original.
